portscanner is a basic tool to scan for open ports in IP Addresses. 



Instructions for user:
open your Terminal and type "python3 portscanner.py"
then it will ask for the IP Address you want to scan. If you have only one IP Address, just type it and hit enter. 
If you have more than one IP Addresses, seperate them by using a ','.
After that, it will ask you to enter the number of ports you want to scan (eg. 100)
After you enter the number of ports you want to scan, it will start scanning from port no 1 to the number of port you entered.
Afer scanning, it will show the results of only those ports, which are open.
