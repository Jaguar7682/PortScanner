# PortScanner

### The PortScanner is a basic tool designed to scan for open ports in IP addresses. It allows you to identify which ports are open and accessible on a given IP address.

## How to Use

- Open your terminal in any Linux operating system.
- Navigate to the directory where the portscanner.py file is located.
- Run the command python3 portscanner.py.
- The tool will prompt you to enter the IP address(es) you want to scan. If you have only one IP address, enter it and press Enter. If you have multiple IP addresses, separate them using a comma (,).
- Next, you will be asked to enter the number of ports you want to scan. Enter the desired number and press Enter.
- The scanning process will begin, starting from port number 1 up to the specified number of ports.
- After scanning, the tool will display the results, showing only the ports that are open.

### Note: Ensure that you have proper authorization and permission before scanning IP addresses that are not owned or controlled by you. Unauthorized scanning can be unethical and may be illegal. Use this tool responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs.
